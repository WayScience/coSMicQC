    This function uses z-scoring to format the data for detecting outlier
    nuclei or cells using specific CellProfiler features. Thresholds are
    the number of standard deviations away from the mean, either above

    threshold of 0 as that would represent the whole dataset.

    Args:
        df: Union[CytoDataFrame, pd.DataFrame, str]
            DataFrame or file string-based filepath of a
            Parquet, CSV, or TSV file with CytoTable output or similar data.

            outliers "below" the mean.

            Whether to include the threshold scores in addition to whether

            An optional path to export the data using CytoDataFrame export

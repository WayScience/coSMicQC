class ContaminationDetector:
    """_
    This class implements a contamination detection process for high-content morphology data.
    There are three steps to the process:

    1. Check for skewness in the cytoplasm texture and variability in the FormFactor features.
    If either is detected, the process moves on to the next step.
    2. Determine if the whole plate or partial plate is impacted by checking the mean values of the features.
    The process will move on to the last step only if partial contamination is detected in the texture feature.
    3. If partial contamination is detected for texture, find outliers and plot the proportion of outliers per well.

    Attributes
    ----------
    dataframe : pd.DataFrame
        The input DataFrame containing the features to be analyzed.
        Should be the output from the CytoTable convert function.

        contamination is present.
    step_two_test()

        plate or partial plate contamination is present based on the mean of the feature.
    find_texture_outliers()
        Find outliers in the texture feature using the coSMicQC find_outliers function.
    plot_proportion_outliers()
        Plot the proportion of outliers detected in each well.
